00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:04.870
Alright guys, so in the last video we set
up the base package for Backpack.

2
00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:09.470
We have our back-end login and dashboard.

3
00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:14.380
Now we're going to continue on with this documentation
and we're going to install Backpack/CRUD and

4
00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.060
what this does is it allows us to create CRUD
resources.

5
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.199
So, anything that you want to be able to create
read update and delete whether its Todos or

6
00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:30.689
it could be customers blog posts, anything
you want, and this makes it really easy.

7
00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.240
Once we set this up we'll be able to use generators
to easily create CRUD resources because you

8
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:41.090
can either manually create the files yourself
or you can use a generator.

9
00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.880
So, first thing we'll do is install Backpack/CRUD.

10
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:56.980
So, let’s go over here and go to composer
we're going to say require Backpack/CRUD.

11
00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.060
Alright and we're also going to have to add
the provider as we do with all packages so

12
00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:09.830
let’s copy that and go to our Config folder
and then app.php go down to the providers

13
00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:17.580
and let’s go right here and paste that in
just like we did with the base service provider.

14
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.070
Alright and then once that's done we're going
to have to run a bunch of commands here.

15
00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:30.030
So, let’s see, that’s still going, but
we're going to grab this and this will publish

16
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.030
the assets.

17
00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:36.610
Actually, we don't want that comment right
there, just this.

18
00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:42.240
This L finder which has to do with the CRUD
package.

19
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.500
Alright so that's all set lets go ahead and
paste that in and we're going to need to run

20
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.020
all these commands.

21
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.780
This will publish the CRUD assets.

22
00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:02.350
Let’s go ahead and copy that, paste that
in run it.

23
00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:09.880
Okay its really quick, now we're going to
grab this one and this will publish the CRUD

24
00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.420
language files so we'll copy that.

25
00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.510
This one will publish CRUD and custom L finder
config files.

26
00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:27.520
So, these commands are just basically creating
the files that need and then this one here

27
00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:33.520
is going to publish custom L finder views.

28
00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:44.599
Alright, now we need a place, we need a folder
that will allow us to upload files, a place

29
00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:46.190
to upload our files.

30
00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:52.599
So, we can open up the config file systems.php
file which is right here and if we go down

31
00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:58.710
to where the discs are, right here discs,
we have discs for local for public Amazon

32
00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.640
s3 if we were to use that.

33
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.570
We're going to add that inside of that disc’s
array.

34
00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:08.820
So, let’s copy it and just paste it right
in here and it’s going to use the public

35
00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.310
path and then a folder called uploads.

36
00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.080
So, we actually have to create that.

37
00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.989
So, let’s save this and then we're going
to go over here to our public folder and we're

38
00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:24.620
going to create a new folder called uploads
and that is where all the uploads will go.

39
00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:30.940
Now if we want to add a link to the file manager
in our back-end we can do that, let’s just

40
00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:37.900
grab this list item here with the link and
then we're going to go to our views folder,

41
00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.660
Resources\Views\Vendor, wait is this the right
place?

42
00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.379
This might not be right, yes, it is.

43
00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:54.480
Okay so \Vendor\Backpack\Base\Inc and then
sidebar.blade.php and then we'll go down to

44
00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.290
here and you see where the dashboard link
is, we're going to paste that <li> tag right

45
00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:00.900
in there.

46
00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:07.800
Alright and we'll save that and let’s go
back and reload and now we have a file manager

47
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:08.800
link.

48
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.379
If we click that it takes us to the file manager
and we can upload files here.

49
00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:15.989
We can actually drag files over.

50
00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:22.250
So, if we want to try that, let’s see I'll
just grab-- I don't want any of that.

51
00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:30.390
We'll grab a wallpaper here and there it is
and if we look over here in the uploads folder

52
00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:35.110
that we created there it is, wallpaper1.jpg.

53
00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:40.360
So, our system can now handle back-end file
uploads which is really cool.

54
00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:46.210
So, let’s go back to the documentation and
the next thing we can do and this is optional

55
00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.430
but I want to do it, we can install the language
file manager.

56
00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:55.850
So, we're going to just install it with composer
and you can see Backpack has a lot of different

57
00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.139
packages that you can optionally add and remove.

58
00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:05.250
So, let’s go ahead and run that and then
of course we need to add the provider, copy

59
00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:12.970
that and we'll go in to Config app.php and
let’s add that right here.

60
00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:20.370
Okay save it, and then we need to run the
migration here and we're going to add some

61
00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.030
tags on to it.

62
00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.240
Let’s copy that.

63
00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.370
Okay that’s still running.

64
00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:33.400
So, you can see that there are a lot of commands
to create the files that we need, but it’s

65
00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:38.300
a lot quicker than manually doing it.

66
00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:46.919
Alright so now we're going to run this command,
this first migrate command right here and

67
00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:58.540
then this one and then this one.

68
00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:05.520
So, this is going to publish the config file
and then this one is going to publish the

69
00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:13.800
lang file 
and then we'll go down here and we can add

70
00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:21.270
these to our sidebar, these links, copy we'll
go back to sidebar.blade.php and we'll put

71
00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:29.280
them right here and save and then let’s
visit the back-end and reload and now you'll

72
00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.260
notice that we have languages.

73
00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:38.419
So, we can now add different languages to
our site and you can put a flag image, you

74
00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:43.070
can see there are some predefined ones here
and then the language files we can create

75
00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:49.860
now language files so that we can translate
in to a different language, just something

76
00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:52.210
that adds to your functionality.

77
00:06:52.210 --> 00:07:01.960
So, what we're going to do next is create
a CRUD resource and we're going to use customers,

78
00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:07.919
so it’s going to be kind of a mini CRM we'll
be able to add customers create read update

79
00:07:07.919 --> 00:07:09.680
and delete and so on.

80
00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:13.550
It will create a customer’s table in the
back-end and we're going to use a generator

81
00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:14.680
to do that.

82
00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.050
So that’s what we'll get in to next.
